We aspire to innovate something that can be useful for teenage nowadays by listen to 
their words especially UTM student. At the same time, we should look at another 
angle that involves its impact on the environment, quality of lifestyle and also how to 
connect it with technology in a better way.
From the prototype we made, we found that its not easy to build up a new product as 
there is existing product in this world. So, we meet up and discuss to get each other’s 
ideas and choose the best to do. However, we choose to bring up air cooler with solar 
version to solve the UTM’s student’s problem which is weather very hot and expenses 
price. We found out that using solar system is the best way since they generate 
renewable energy which is far better for the environment also not expensive for 
student.
For me, I should get better in communication because to create something in a group 
there is one important thing which is communication. We must hear other’s opinion 
and combine it to get an ideas. Other than that, I must to do a research to produce a 
product or to modify an existing product. Since It was group work, its important to 
give task to each other so that all the group member’s have their own work to do. 
Other’s soft skill is very important and I need to learn more and improving myself to 
get better in future
