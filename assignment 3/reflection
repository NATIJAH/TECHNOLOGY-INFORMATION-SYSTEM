From the industrial talk by Miss Qistina, I learned a few qualities from her such as to never give up during the 
battle with hardships, and to not doubt my capabilities, learn to cooperate with others and always be inquisitive 
to learn new things. Being a system developer in the next four years will no doubt require a plentiful amount of 
patience and a fastidious approach in dealing with the ever-growing field of technology. I envisioned myself as a 
skillful developer that has mastered the skills that are needed to compete with fellow colleagues. The challenges 
that might arise from the furious competition is that as a system developer, we need to be consistent in adapting 
and keeping up with the flow of the development of future technology. In addition to the core skills, I also wished 
to be a system developer that can understand the problems faced by clients so that the development of the system can 
greatly benefit different societies and leave a lasting impact by reducing the obstacles in humanityâ€™s mission to fully 
harvest the technology we developed along the way for the future generation as well.
